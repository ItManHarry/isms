Built-in class-based generic views
Django ships with generic views to do the following:
    1. Display list and detail pages for a single object. If we were creating an application to manage conferences then a TalkListView and a RegisteredUserListView would be examples of list views. A single talk page is an example of what we call a “detail” view.
    2. Present date-based objects in year/month/day archive pages, associated detail, and “latest” pages.
    3. Allow users to create, update, and delete objects – with or without authorization.
